        Elon Reeve Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who
        founded X.com in 1999(which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003.
        Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to
        a division of Compaq Computers.\n\nMusk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a
        rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He
        bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016, and cemented his standing as
        a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald
        Trump\'s administration.
